# TASK MANAGER

My name is [David Lozano](https://github.com/DavidTheMaaster) and I'm a videogame developer student at [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/), UPC. This content is created for the subject of Project 2 and supervised by [Ricard Pillosu](https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu).
This is a research about Task Manager and Task Queues on C++ and I will teach you the basics so you can apply them on your own videogame. 

## Task Queues

Tasks are work that can be handled asynchronously, because they are long-runnig work and we can't wait until it finishes to continue with the game. To be able to manage them we use a Task Queue, when you add all the tasks you want and it will execute them in the background. 
There are 2 types of Task Queues: Push Queues and Pull queues
